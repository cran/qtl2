\usage{
scan1coef(
  genoprobs,
  pheno,
  kinship = NULL,
  addcovar = NULL,
  nullcovar = NULL,
  intcovar = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{genoprobs}{Genotype probabilities as calculated by
\code{\link[=calc_genoprob]{calc_genoprob()}}.}

\item{pheno}{A numeric vector of phenotype values (just one phenotype, not a matrix of them)}

\item{kinship}{Optional kinship matrix, or a list of kinship matrices (one
per chromosome), in order to use the LOCO (leave one chromosome
out) method.}

\item{addcovar}{An optional numeric matrix of additive covariates.}

\item{nullcovar}{An optional numeric matrix of additional additive
covariates that are used under the null hypothesis (of no QTL) but
not under the alternative (with a QTL). This is needed for the X
chromosome, where we might need sex as a additive covariate under
the null hypothesis, but we wouldn't want to include it under the
alternative as it would be collinear with the QTL effects. Only
used if \code{kinship} is provided but \code{hsq} is not, to get
estimate of residual heritability.}

\item{intcovar}{An optional numeric matrix of interactive covariates.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of positive weights for the
individuals. As with the other inputs, it must have \code{names}
for individual identifiers.}

\item{contrasts}{An optional numeric matrix of genotype contrasts, size
genotypes x genotypes. For an intercross, you might use
\code{cbind(mu=c(1,1,1), a=c(-1, 0, 1), d=c(0, 1, 0))} to get
mean, additive effect, and dominance effect. The default is the
identity matrix.}

\item{model}{Indicates whether to use a normal model (least
squares) or binary model (logistic regression) for the phenotype.
If \code{model="binary"}, the phenotypes must have values in \eqn{[0, 1]}.}

\item{zerosum}{If TRUE, force the genotype or allele coefficients
sum to 0 by subtracting their mean and add another column with
the mean. Ignored if \code{contrasts} is provided.}

\item{se}{If TRUE, also calculate the standard errors.}

\item{hsq}{(Optional) residual heritability; used only if
\code{kinship} provided.}

\item{reml}{If \code{kinship} provided: if \code{reml=TRUE}, use
REML; otherwise maximum likelihood.}

\item{...}{Additional control parameters; see Details;}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"scan1coef"}: a matrix of estimated regression coefficients, of dimension
positions x number of effects. The number of effects is
\code{n_genotypes + n_addcovar + (n_genotypes-1)*n_intcovar}.
May also contain the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{SE} - Present if \code{se=TRUE}: a matrix of estimated
standard errors, of same dimension as \code{coef}.
\item \code{sample_size} - Vector of sample sizes used for each
phenotype
}
}
\description{
Calculate QTL effects in scan along one chromosome with a
single-QTL model using Haley-Knott regression or a linear mixed
model (the latter to account for a residual polygenic effect), with
possible allowance for covariates.
}
\details{
For each of the inputs, the row names are used as
individual identifiers, to align individuals.

If \code{kinship} is absent, Haley-Knott regression is performed.
If \code{kinship} is provided, a linear mixed model is used, with a
polygenic effect estimated under the null hypothesis of no (major)
QTL, and then taken as fixed as known in the genome scan.

If \code{contrasts} is provided, the genotype probability matrix,
\eqn{P}, is post-multiplied by the contrasts matrix, \eqn{A}, prior
to fitting the model. So we use \eqn{P \cdot A}{P A} as the \eqn{X}
matrix in the model. One might view the rows of
\ifelse{html}{\out{<em>A</em><sup>-1</sup>}}{\eqn{A^{-1}}}
as the set of contrasts, as the estimated effects are the estimated
genotype effects pre-multiplied by
\ifelse{html}{\out{<em>A</em><sup>-1</sup>}}{\eqn{A^{-1}}}.

The \code{...} argument can contain several additional control
parameters; suspended for simplicity (or confusion, depending on
your point of view). \code{tol} is used as a tolerance value for linear
regression by QR decomposition (in determining whether columns are
linearly dependent on others and should be omitted); default
\code{1e-12}. \code{maxit} is the maximum number of iterations for
converence of the iterative algorithm used when \code{model=binary}.
\code{bintol} is used as a tolerance for converence for the iterative
algorithm used when \code{model=binary}. \code{eta_max} is the maximum value
for the "linear predictor" in the case \code{model="binary"} (a bit of a
technicality to avoid fitted values exactly at 0 or 1).

# calculate coefficients for chromosome 7
